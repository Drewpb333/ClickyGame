ClickyGame: Peanuts Version

ClickyGame is a React.js-based application that tests your memory skills with Peanut characters. 
Each game consists of 12 Peanuts cards.  You may only click on each character's card once; after every click, the cards will be rearranged.  Your goal is to click all 12 cards only once.

Good Luck!
